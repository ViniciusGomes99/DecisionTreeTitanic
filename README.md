# Titanic Survival Prediction Using Decision Trees

## Project Overview
These packages are installed and loaded dynamically if they are not already installed.

## Data Overview
We are working with the Titanic dataset, which contains various features like passenger class, sex, age, etc. The initial exploration of the dataset includes understanding its structure and some basic descriptive statistics.

## Key Components
- **Data Exploration:** Analyzing the Titanic dataset to understand the distribution of various features.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating histograms and plots for a better understanding of the data distribution.
- **Model Training:** Splitting the data into training and testing sets and building a decision tree model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy metrics on both training and test sets.
- **Prediction and Analysis:** Classifying individuals as survivors or non-survivors and analyzing the model's predictions.

## Model Building and Evaluation
The decision tree model is built using the `rpart` package. The model is trained on features like passenger class, sex, age, etc., to predict survival. The accuracy of the model is calculated on both training and testing datasets to evaluate its performance.

## Results and Interpretation
The output of the model provides us with the probability of survival of individuals based on their characteristics. Histograms and plots are used to visualize the accuracy and predictions of the model.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the construction of a decision tree algorithm to predict the survival of individuals on the Titanic. It shows how machine learning can be used to extract meaningful insights from historical data.
